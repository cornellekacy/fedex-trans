						<p>In our line of work, deadlines affect success. Our entire experience in the field is based on timelines. We can often place a fix on special opportunities if we know the truth and the timeline. Not only does UPSC-USA deliver but they tell you what’s going on along the way. We definitely enjoy their level of service whether it be during the day or during the middle of the night. UPSC-USA understands we are not making it up when we ask for a truck at some obscure dock at 4:00 am. UPSC-USA is responsive, works through the available options and is determined that we are satisfied.</p>

							<p>UPSC-USA Logistics and my company have been working together since 2008. During this time, we have nearly doubled in size and so has the number of challenging shipping opportunities. UPSC-USA Logistics provides exactly the service we need. They do a good job of understanding our requirements and providing solutions to meet those requirements. They are always available live, 24 hours a day. Their personnel make sure that our delivery needs, which can be complicated, are understood and met. Their attention to detail and follow up separates them from their competitors. I do not need to follow up to check on our shipments. Instead UPSC-USA sends updates and delivery results. In short they provide peace of mind. UPSC-USA stands out in their niche of the freight business.</p>

							<p>As the Supply Chain Manager, I understand the importance of being able to trust and continually depend on a freight forwarder to both move and manage my product when it leaves the facility. I need to know that once it’s in their hands, it will be taken care of and that they will stay out in front of any obstacle that is thrown at them. With UPSC-USA, I can always count on that. We have done business with UPSC-USA for years and from day one, I knew that they would become my primary forwarder. I knew that what UPSC-USA said was genuine and honest. Every shipment that they handle for us is worry-free because they do everything the way they said they would and make sure that our expectations are exceeded, even if there are issues and or delays with the shipment. I was promised a certain level of customer service and dedication and they continually provide that to me every time. I have worked with many freight forwarders and logistics companies in my career and I can tell you without hesitation that UPSC-USA is by far the best I have ever worked with.</p>
